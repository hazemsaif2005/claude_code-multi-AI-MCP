## Introduction

In today's fast-paced tech environment, coding needs to be efficient and error-free. The Claude Code Multi-AI MCP combines the strengths of multiple AI systems to provide a comprehensive solution for code review and fixes. By integrating Grok, Gemini, and DeepSeek, this setup allows for a more thorough examination of code, identifying issues that a single AI might miss.

## Features

- **Multi-AI Integration**: Leverage the unique strengths of Grok, Gemini, and DeepSeek.
- **Code Review**: Get detailed feedback on code quality and best practices.
- **Automated Fixes**: Receive suggestions for code improvements and automatic fixes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands to initiate reviews and fixes.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive guides to help you get started quickly.

## Installation

To get started, you need to download the latest release. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/hazemsaif2005/claude_code-multi-AI-MCP/releases) to find the necessary files. Download the relevant package, and follow the steps below to install it.

1. **Download the Release**: Click on the latest release and download the appropriate file for your system.
2. **Extract the Files**: Unzip the downloaded file to your desired location.
3. **Run the Installer**: Execute the installer script provided in the package.

### System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection for AI model access
- 4GB RAM minimum
- 1GB free disk space

## Usage

Once you have installed the package, you can start using the Claude Code Multi-AI MCP. Open your terminal and navigate to the installation directory. Use the following command to initiate a code review:

```bash
python claude_code_mcp.py --review your_code_file.py
```

Replace `your_code_file.py` with the path to your code file. The AI will analyze the code and provide feedback.

### Example Command

To run a review on a sample file, use:

```bash
python claude_code_mcp.py --review sample_code.py
```

The output will include suggestions for improvements and any errors found.

## How It Works

The Claude Code Multi-AI MCP operates by sending your code to the integrated AI systems. Each AI evaluates the code based on its unique algorithms and provides feedback. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each AI's role:

- **Grok**: Focuses on syntax and logical errors, ensuring that the code adheres to programming standards.
- **Gemini**: Specializes in optimization, suggesting ways to enhance performance and efficiency.
- **DeepSeek**: Looks for deeper issues, such as potential security vulnerabilities and best practices.

The feedback from each AI is then compiled and presented to you in an easy-to-understand format.
